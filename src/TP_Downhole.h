Library for TP-Downhole pressure and tempurature sensor, made by Northern Widget LLC.

Hardware info located at: https://github.com/NorthernWidget/TP-DownHole

The TP-Downhole is a small form factor tempreture and pressure sensor which uses a combination of an 
MS5803 pressure sensor and an MCP3421 ADC in combination with a thermistor for high accuracy
tempreture measurment.
